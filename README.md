# BendySaveLoad
## Bendy and the Ink Machine Save and Load script

### How does it work?
This script automatically copies the batim.game save file of Bendy and the Ink Machine after locating it in your system in a folder named "Backups" when you save and overwrites it back when you load. Inside the Backups folder you can have as many saves as you want, but you can only delete them manually. The script also automatically restarts the game after loading a save to make the changes effective. ONLY WINDOWS!
